# 1 — High-level architecture (summary)

* **Frontend:** React + Tailwind (single-page app). Talks to API Gateway (auth via JWT).
* **API Gateway:** Routes to microservices, enforces auth, rate-limits, central CORS, static web host if desired.
* **Eureka Service Registry:** All services register here (service discovery).
* **Config Server (optional but recommended):** Centralized config for all microservices.
* **Microservices (6):**

  1. **Auth Service** — user registration, login, JWT issuance, refresh token handling.
  2. **User/Profile Service** — user profile data (bio, avatar, settings).
  3. **Post Service (Blog)** — creates/reads/updates/deletes blog posts; primary “domain” service.
  4. **Comment Service** — stores comments, moderation flags.
  5. **Media Service** — handles image uploads, CDN pointers; stores metadata.
  6. **Notification Service** — pushes notifications (email/push) and handles in-app notifications.
* **Kafka Cluster** — asynchronous event bus (topics for post-created, comment-created, user-updated, media-processed, etc).
* **MySQL:** Each microservice has its own MySQL instance/schema; no direct DB sharing.
* **Monitoring & Tracing:** Spring Boot Actuator (each service), Prometheus + Grafana, Zipkin/OpenTelemetry tracing, centralized logging (ELK/EFK).
* **Other components:** RabbitMQ not required (we use Kafka), Redis for caching/session if needed.

# 2 — Why this split & responsibilities

* **Auth Service** (critical): centralizes authentication/authorization and issues JWTs. Keeps sensitive logic in one place.
* **User/Profile Service**: user-centric data separate from auth to reduce coupling and allow richer profile features without touching Auth internals.
* **Post Service**: core blog domain — owns post lifecycle and primary business rules.
* **Comment Service**: comments can scale differently and have different retention / moderation logic.
* **Media Service**: separate storage and processing (resizing) responsibilities; can integrate with cloud storage (S3) later.
* **Notification Service**: handles both immediate notifications (synchronous where necessary) and async (via Kafka) to decouple from business flows.

This separation supports independent scaling, deployments, and technology choices per service while keeping ownership clear.

# 3 — Databases (one per service)

Each microservice uses its **own MySQL** database (schema). Example DB names:

* `auth_db`
* `user_db`
* `post_db`
* `comment_db`
* `media_db`
* `notification_db`

Use Spring Data JPA + Hibernate in each service for ORM. Each service defines its own entities and migrations (Flyway/Liquibase recommended per service).

# 4 — Data models (simplified schemas)

Below are minimal table designs to get you started. Add indexes and constraints as needed.

## Auth Service (`auth_db`)

* `users`:

  * `id` (BIGINT PK, auto)
  * `username` (VARCHAR, unique)
  * `email` (VARCHAR, unique)
  * `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
  * `roles` (VARCHAR) — CSV or separate table if complex
  * `enabled` (BOOLEAN)
  * `created_at`, `updated_at`
* `refresh_tokens`:

  * `id`, `user_id`, `token`, `expires_at`, `created_at`

Note: The Auth Service **does not** store profile details beyond auth fields.

## User/Profile Service (`user_db`)

* `profiles`:

  * `id` (BIGINT PK) — maps to `auth.users.id`
  * `full_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`
  * `location`, `website`
  * `created_at`, `updated_at`
* `user_settings` (optional)
* `following` (if social features)

## Post Service (`post_db`)

* `posts`:

  * `id` (BIGINT PK)
  * `slug` (VARCHAR, unique)
  * `title`, `content` (TEXT)
  * `author_id` (BIGINT) — maps to `user/profile`/`auth` user id
  * `status` (enum: DRAFT/PUBLISHED/ARCHIVED)
  * `tags` (TEXT or normalized table)
  * `image_id` (BIGINT) — link to Media Service metadata ID
  * `created_at`, `updated_at`, `published_at`
* `post_tags` (if normalized): `post_id`, `tag`
* `post_stats` (separate table): views, likes (for write scaling)

## Comment Service (`comment_db`)

* `comments`:

  * `id`, `post_id` (FK to Post but not enforced across DB), `author_id`, `content`, `parent_comment_id` (nullable), `status` (VISIBLE/MOD/DELETED), `created_at`, `updated_at`
* `comment_votes` (optional)

## Media Service (`media_db`)

* `media`:

  * `id`, `owner_id`, `original_filename`, `mime_type`, `storage_url`, `thumbnail_url`, `status` (PENDING/PROCESSED), `created_at`
* `media_processing_jobs` (if asynchronous conversions)

## Notification Service (`notification_db`)

* `notifications`:

  * `id`, `user_id`, `type` (POST\_COMMENT, POST\_LIKE, FOLLOW), `payload` (JSON), `read` (boolean), `created_at`
* `email_queue` (if async send)

# 5 — API Contracts (representative endpoints)

Design RESTful endpoints for each service. Use API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) and consistent response envelopes.

### Auth Service (sync)

* `POST /api/v1/auth/register` — {username,email,password} -> 201 created
* `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — {username,password} -> {accessToken, refreshToken}
* `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` — {refreshToken} -> new access token
* `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token
* `GET /api/v1/auth/users/{id}/roles` — internal service-to-service (RestTemplate) call

### User/Profile Service

* `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` — returns profile
* `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` — update profile (auth required)
* `GET /api/v1/users/{id}/posts` — query posts (via Post Service or from a denormalized cache)
* `GET /api/v1/users/search?q=...` — search users

### Post Service (domain)

* `GET /api/v1/posts` — paging, filtering, tag search
* `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}` or `/slug/{slug}`
* `POST /api/v1/posts` — create post (auth) — synchronous call to Auth/User Service via RestTemplate to verify author profile (or decode JWT to get author id)

  * After successful create: publish `post.created` Kafka event.
* `PUT /api/v1/posts/{id}` — update (auth + ownership)
* `DELETE /api/v1/posts/{id}` — delete
* `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}/stats` — views/likes

### Comment Service

* `POST /api/v1/comments` — {postId, content, parentCommentId} — will publish `comment.created` Kafka event
* `GET /api/v1/comments?postId=...` — list comments

### Media Service

* `POST /api/v1/media` — upload metadata or signed URL request. Can accept binary upload or return signed presigned URL to client. Publishes `media.uploaded` Kafka event.
* `GET /api/v1/media/{id}` — metadata

### Notification Service

* `GET /api/v1/notifications` — user notifications
* `POST /api/v1/notifications/mark-read` — mark notifications read
* Notification service consumes `post.created`, `comment.created`, `user.followed` topics and creates notification rows and triggers emails.

# 6 — Synchronous vs Asynchronous communication patterns

You asked for **REST Template** and **Kafka** to both be used — we will use both:

### Synchronous calls (RestTemplate)

* Use when immediate response required and low latency expected.
* Examples:

  * Post Service calls **User/Profile Service** to fetch author display name or avatar (via RestTemplate). Prefer decoding JWT to get `authorId` and only call if more profile data is needed.
  * Gateway -> Auth Service to validate tokens (or token validation via JWT introspection locally using public key).
* Use `RestTemplate` (or WebClient) with timeouts and `@Retry`/circuit breaker patterns (Resilience4j) to prevent cascading failures.

### Asynchronous (Kafka)

* Use Kafka for decoupling and eventual consistency.
* Mandatory event flows:

  * `post.created` — published by Post Service after DB commit
  * `post.updated` / `post.deleted`
  * `comment.created` — published by Comment Service
  * `media.uploaded`, `media.processed`
  * `user.updated` — emitted by User/Profile Service
* Consumers:

  * Notification Service consumes `post.created`, `comment.created` to create notifications.
  * Search/Feed Service (if you add) consumes `post.created` to update search index (ElasticSearch).
  * Analytics/Stats service consumes events to update aggregated counters.
* Kafka topics: `post-events`, `comment-events`, `media-events`, `user-events`, `notification-events`.
* Event schema: JSON with `eventType`, `entityId`, `payload`, `timestamp`, `traceId`.

# 7 — Event design (sample)

**Topic:** `post-events`
**Message example (JSON):**

```json
{
  "eventType": "POST_CREATED",
  "postId": 123,
  "authorId": 45,
  "title": "My Blog Title",
  "slug": "my-blog-title",
  "tags": ["spring","microservices"],
  "publishedAt": "2025-09-11T10:00:00Z",
  "payload": { "snippet": "..." },
  "traceId": "abcd-1234",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-11T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Consumers should be idempotent.

# 8 — Transactions & Consistency

* **Avoid distributed ACID transactions** across microservice DBs. Use **event-driven eventual consistency** and patterns like **Saga** for multi-step business flows that must be compensated.
* Example: Creating a post and sending notification:

  * Post Service writes post to `post_db` (transaction).
  * On commit, publishes `POST_CREATED`.
  * Notification Service consumes event and writes notification.
* To ensure event published only if DB commit succeeds: publish event **after** commit (outbox pattern). Implement the Outbox pattern:

  * Post inserts event to `outbox` table within same DB transaction; a background process polls/flushes outbox and writes to Kafka. This avoids lost events.

# 9 — Security

* Use **Auth Service** issuing **JWT access tokens** (short-lived) and **refresh tokens** (long-lived).
* API Gateway enforces token validation (verify signature / expiration). Gateway forwards user id or roles in headers to downstream services.
* Services still must verify JWT or call Auth Service when sensitive checks needed.
* Use HTTPS everywhere.
* Principle of least privilege: tokens carry minimal claims.
* Use Spring Security in all services to secure internal endpoints; inter-service calls should use mTLS or service-to-service tokens if required.

# 10 — API Gateway, Service Discovery, Config, Observability

* **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway or Kong/Traefik.

  * Responsibilities: routing, authentication enforcement, rate limiting, request/response transformation, caching at edge, TLS termination.
* **Service Discovery:** Eureka server (Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka). Services register themselves; Gateway and internal clients can discover service instances.
* **Config Server:** Spring Cloud Config Server (optional, recommended). Centralize YAML/Properties so you don’t hardcode DB credentials in each service (use Vault for secrets later).
* **Actuator:** Enable Actuator endpoints on each service for `health`, `metrics`, `prometheus` scrape, `httptrace`. Only expose required endpoints and secure them.
* **Tracing & Logging:** Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin/OpenTelemetry; centralized structured logs (JSON) using Logstash/Fluentd to Elastic/Cloud logging.
* **Metrics:** Prometheus exporter (Micrometer) + Grafana dashboards.

# 11 — Resiliency & Observability

* Circuit breaker (Resilience4j) for RestTemplate calls.
* Timeouts & retries: set sensible values and exponential backoff.
* Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation.
* Health checks exposed by Actuator `/actuator/health`, readiness & liveness probes for Kubernetes.
* Use `traceId` propagation across calls/events.

# 12 — Caching & Performance

* Use Redis for:

  * Caching user profile lookup to reduce user-service calls.
  * Caching post lists or popular posts, invalidated by events.
* Use CDN for static assets served by Media Service.

# 13 — Search & Feed (optional microservice)

* If you want full-text search and feed generation, add a **Search Service** that ingests `post-events` and indexes into ElasticSearch. Not mandatory but typical for blogs.

# 14 — Logging & Error handling

* Standardized error responses: `{code, message, details, timestamp}`.
* Use global exception handlers in each service to map exceptions to HTTP responses.
* Retries for async consumers should be idempotent; use dead-letter topics for failed events.

# 15 — Monitoring endpoints & actuator details

Expose Actuator endpoints (secure):

* `/actuator/health`
* `/actuator/metrics`
* `/actuator/prometheus` (Micrometer)
* `/actuator/httptrace` (debug)
* `/actuator/loggers`
* `/actuator/env` (restricted)
  Set `management.server.port` optionally to separate port.

# 16 — Dev / Deployment strategy

* Containerize each service with Docker.
* Use Kubernetes for orchestration (recommended) or Docker Compose for local dev.
* CI/CD: build each service separately, run unit/integration tests, push images to registry, then deploy via Helm / k8s manifests.
* Use separate MySQL instances per service (can be single MySQL server with distinct schemas for dev, but production should isolate).
* Separate CI pipeline for frontend (React) that produces static assets and deploys to CDN or static hosting. Or serve through Gateway.

# 17 — Migration plan (step-by-step)

1. **Prep:** Set up Eureka, API Gateway, Config Server, Kafka dev cluster, MySQL instances, Dev Docker/K8s.
2. **Extract Auth Service:** Move authentication out of monolith first (lowest coupling). Create Auth Service; update monolith to call it for login/registration or swap login UI to call Auth service. Issue JWTs.
3. **Introduce API Gateway:** Configure routes; secure with JWT. Point frontend to Gateway.
4. **Extract Post Service:** Move post domain next. Keep monolith calling Post DB via new Post Service endpoints. Use RestTemplate for calls from monolith to Profile Service if needed.
5. **Extract User/Profile Service** and migrate profile data (ensure consistent IDs).
6. **Extract Comment & Media Services** — use Kafka to decouple comment creation & media processing where needed.
7. **Introduce Notification Service** as Kafka consumer.
8. **Cut-over & Decommission:** Once functionality is stable in microservices, gradually remove corresponding monolith modules.
9. **Hardening:** Add observability, resilience features, backup strategies.

# 18 — Testing strategy

* **Unit tests** per service (JUnit + Mockito).
* **Integration tests** with in-memory DB (H2) or testcontainers (Real MySQL in containers).
* **Contract tests** (Pact) between services to validate REST contracts.
* **Kafka consumer/producer tests** using embedded Kafka or Testcontainers Kafka.
* **End-to-end tests**: test flows from frontend to backend (Selenium / Playwright).

# 19 — Sample flows (textual sequence)

## Create Post (sync + async)

1. Client POST `/gateway/api/v1/posts` with JWT.
2. Gateway forwards to Post Service, validates JWT (optionally consults Auth or validates signature).
3. Post Service persists into `post_db`.
4. Post Service inserts event into `outbox` table (same DB transaction) — ensures atomicity.
5. Outbox worker publishes `post.created` to Kafka.
6. Notification Service consumes `post.created` -> creates notifications.
7. Search Service consumes `post.created` -> indexes.

## Add Comment (async)

1. Client POST `/gateway/api/v1/comments`.
2. Comment Service saves comment and publishes `comment.created`.
3. Notification Service consumes and notifies post author.

# 20 — Topics, naming & conventions

* Topic names: `post-events`, `comment-events`, `media-events`, `user-events`, `notification-events`.
* Event types: `POST_CREATED`, `POST_UPDATED`, `COMMENT_CREATED`, `MEDIA_PROCESSED`, `USER_UPDATED`.
* Use semantic versioning for APIs: `/api/v1/...`, `/api/v2/...` when making breaking changes.

# 21 — Cross-cutting concerns & recommended libs

* Spring Boot 3.2.x, Java 17 (same as your monolith).
* Spring Data JPA + Hibernate.
* Kafka: `spring-kafka`.
* RestTemplate: `spring-web` (note: RestTemplate is deprecated in favor of WebClient, but you requested RestTemplate — it's still available; prefer WebClient for reactive flows).
* Eureka: `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` & server.
* Gateway: `spring-cloud-starter-gateway` or use non-Java gateway.
* Actuator + Micrometer: `micrometer-registry-prometheus`.
* Resilience4j: circuit breaker, retry.
* Flyway or Liquibase for DB migrations.
* Testcontainers for integration testing.

# 22 — Frontend (React + Tailwind) integration notes

* Frontend communicates with API Gateway only.
* JWT workflow:

  * Login -> Auth Service returns `accessToken` + `refreshToken`.
  * Store `accessToken` in memory or http-only cookie (recommended: http-only secure cookie).
  * Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API calls.
* For file uploads (images): frontend either uploads directly to Media Service (which can return signed URL for cloud storage) or uses Gateway to proxy.
* Implement optimistic UI updates for posts/comments and refresh via real-time (WebSocket) or via polling.

# 23 — Observability & dashboards to build

* Health dashboard (service statuses).
* Traffic & latency per service.
* Kafka consumer lag dashboard.
* Error rates and slow endpoints (APM).
* Traces: follow a single user request across services using `traceId`.

# 24 — Practical checklist to implement (prioritized)

1. Create core infra: Eureka server, Config server, Kafka, MySQL instances, API Gateway.
2. Build Auth Service (JWT + refresh).
3. Build API Gateway and secure with JWT validation.
4. Extract Post Service (DB, APIs, event outbox).
5. Extract User/Profile Service.
6. Extract Comment & Media services.
7. Build Notification Service as Kafka consumer.
8. Hook Actuator + Prometheus + Grafana + Zipkin.
9. Add Redis caching for heavy-read endpoints.
10. Add CI/CD pipeline and helm charts / k8s manifests.
11. Create frontend SPA in React + Tailwind, connecting to Gateway and implementing auth properly.

# 25 — Non-functional considerations

* **Scaling:** Post/Comment/Media scale more than User/Auth. Deploy replicas accordingly.
* **Backups:** MySQL backups per database.
* **Secrets:** Store DB passwords and JWT keys in Vault / K8s Secret.
* **Cost & ops:** Kafka + multiple MySQL instances add ops burden; consider managed services if possible.

# 26 — Example pitfalls & how to avoid

* **Tight coupling via DB:** never share DB tables across services; use APIs/events.
* **Lost events:** use outbox pattern to guarantee event delivery.
* **Blocking sync calls:** avoid long synchronous chains; use circuit breakers and timeouts.
* **Schema drift:** version events and APIs early.

# 27 — Extensions you can add later

* Search Service (ElasticSearch)
* Feed/Timeline Service for personalization
* Rate-limiting & WAF at Gateway
* Real-time updates via WebSocket/Socket.IO (could be separate PubSub service)
* Multi-region/cross-region replication for high availability

---

## Final tips (practical)

* Start small: get Auth + Gateway + Post + Eureka working first.
* Use Testcontainers in CI to test with real services.
* Keep APIs small and well-documented (OpenAPI / Swagger).
* Automate database migrations with Flyway.
* Keep Kafka event schemas backward compatible — include `version` in events.
